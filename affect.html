<center><p> Thousand of animals are suffering and being tortured every single day because of animal testing. </p></center>

	<center><p>  Written in an article by New England Anti-Vivisection Society, it states, "Animals in labs live stressful, monotonous, and unnatural lives of daily confinement and deprivation. The only changes in their lives may come from being called into a research or testing protocol, which may include an invasive experiment, or a procedure whose endpoint is death.

Every year in the U.S., over 25 million animals are used in biomedical experimentation, product and cosmetic testing, and science education. This includes
; dogs, cats, ferrets, rabbits, pigs, sheep, monkeys, chimpanzees, and more. However, the majority of animals in labs (over 90 percent) are rats, mice, and birds. Some estimates place them in the tens to hundreds of millions."
